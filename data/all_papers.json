The focus of this study is on learning thermodynamic properties from molecular-liquid simulations. The methodology relies on an atomic representation originally developed for electronic properties: the Spectrum of London and Axilrod-Teller-Muto representation (SLATM). SLATM's expansion in one-, two-, and three-body interactions makes it amenable to probing structural ordering in molecular liquids. We show that such representation encodes enough critical information to permit the learning of thermodynamic properties via linear methods. We demonstrate our approach on the preferential insertion of small solute molecules toward cardiolipin membranes and monitor selectivity against a similar lipid. Our analysis reveals simple, interpretable relationships between two- and three-body interactions and selectivity, identifies key interactions to build optimal prototypical solutes, and charts a two-dimensional projection that displays clearly separated basins. The methodology is generally applicable to a variety of thermodynamic properties.","1":"Amyloid-like nanofibers from self-assembling peptides can promote viral gene transfer for therapeutic applications. Traditionally, new sequences are discovered either from screening large libraries or by creating derivatives of known active peptides. However, the discovery of de novo peptides, which are sequence-wise not related to any known active peptides, is limited by the difficulty to rationally predict structure-activity relationships because their activities typically have multi-scale and multi-parameter dependencies. Here, we used a small library of 163 peptides as a training set to predict de novo sequences for viral infectivity enhancement using a machine learning (ML) approach based on natural language processing. Specifically, we trained an ML model using continuous vector representations of the peptides, which were previously shown to retain relevant information embedded in the sequences. We used the trained ML model to sample the sequence space of peptides with 6 amino acids to identify promising candidates. These 6-mers were then further screened for charge and aggregation propensity. The resulting 16 new 6-mers were tested and found to be active with a 25% hit rate. Strikingly, these de novo sequences are the shortest active peptides for infectivity enhancement reported so far and show no sequence relation to the training set. Moreover, by screening the sequence space, we discovered the first hydrophobic peptide fibrils with a moderately negative surface charge that can enhance infectivity. Hence, this ML strategy is a time- and cost-efficient way for expanding the sequence space of short functional self-assembling peptides exemplified for therapeutic viral gene delivery.","2":"The primary structures of peptides, originating from food proteins, a\ufb00ect their taste. Connecting primary structure to taste, however, is di\ufb03cult because the size of the peptide sequence space increases exponentially with increasing peptide length, while experimentally-labeled data on peptides\u2019 tastes remain scarce. We propose a method that coarse-grains the sequence space to reduce its size and systematically identi\ufb01es the most common coarse-grained residue patterns found in known bitter and umami peptides. We select the optimal patterns by performing extensive out-of-sample tests. The optimal patterns better represent the bitter and umami peptides when compared against baseline peptides, bitter peptides with all hydrophobic residues and umami peptides with all negatively charged residues, and peptides with randomly-chosen residues. Our method complements quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship methods by o\ufb00ering generic, coarse-grained bitter and umami residue patterns that can aid in locating short bitter or umami segments in a protein and in designing new umami peptides.","3":"Compared to top-down coarse-grained (CG) models, bottom-up approaches are capable of offering higher structural fidelity. This fidelity results from the tight link to a higher resolution reference, making the CG model chemically specific. Unfortunately, chemical specificity can be at odds with compound-screening strategies, which call for transferable parameterizations. Here, we present an approach to reconcile bottom-up, structure-preserving CG models with chemical transferability. We consider the bottom-up CG parameterization of 3441 C7O2 small-molecule isomers. Our approach combines atomic representations, unsupervised learning, and a large-scale extended-ensemble force-matching parameterization. We first identify a subset of 19 representative molecules, which maximally encode the local environment of all gas-phase conformers. Reference interactions between the 19 representative molecules were obtained from both homogeneous bulk liquids and various binary mixtures. An extended-ensemble parameterization over all 703 state points leads to a CG model that is both structure-based and chemically transferable. Remarkably, the resulting force field is on average more structurally accurate than single-state-point equivalents. Averaging over the extended ensemble acts as a mean-force regularizer, smoothing out both force and structural correlations that are overly specific to a single-state point. Our approach aims at transferability through a set of CG bead types that can be used to easily construct new molecules while retaining the benefits of a structure-based parameterization.","4":"The potential of mean force is an effective coarse-grained potential, which is often approximated by pairwise potentials. While the approximated potential reproduces certain distributions of the reference all-atom model with remarkable accuracy, important cross-correlations are typically not captured. In general, the quality of coarse-grained models is evaluated at the coarse-grained resolution, hindering the detection of important discrepancies between the all-atom and coarse-grained ensembles. In this work, the quality of different coarse-grained models is assessed at the atomistic resolution deploying reverse-mapping strategies. In particular, coarse-grained structures for Tris-Meta-Biphenyl-Triazine are reverse-mapped from two different sources: 1) All-atom configurations projected onto the coarse-grained resolution and 2) snapshots obtained by molecular dynamics simulations based on the coarse-grained force fields. To assess the quality of the coarse-grained models, reverse-mapped structures of both sources are compared revealing significant discrepancies between the all-atom and the coarse-grained ensembles. Specifically, the reintroduced details enable force computations based on the all-atom force field that yield a clear ranking for the quality of the different coarse-grained models.","5":"The prosperity and lifestyle of our society are very much governed by achievements in condensed matter physics, chemistry and materials science, because new products for sectors such as energy, the environment, health, mobility and information technology (IT) rely largely on improved or even new materials. Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries, implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready' (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today. In this Perspective, we discuss how we can prepare to make this happen for the field of materials science.","6":"Cardiolipin, the mitochondria marker lipid, is crucially involved in stabilizing the inner mitochondrial membrane and is vital for the activity of mitochondrial proteins and protein complexes. Directly targeting cardiolipin by a chemical-biology approach and thereby altering the cellular concentration of \u201cavailable\u201d cardiolipin eventually allows to systematically study the dependence of cellular processes on cardiolipin availability. In the present study, physics-based coarse-grained free energy calculations allowed us to identify the physical and chemical properties indicative of cardiolipin selectivity and to apply these to screen a compound database for putative cardiolipin-binders. The membrane binding properties of the 22 most promising molecules identified in the in silico approach were screened in vitro, using model membrane systems finally resulting in the identification of a single molecule, CLiB (CardioLipin-Binder). CLiB clearly affects respiration of cardiolipin-containing intact bacterial cells as well as of isolated mitochondria. Thus, the structure and function of mitochondrial membranes and membrane proteins might be (indirectly) targeted and controlled by CLiB for basic research and, potentially, also for therapeutic purposes.","7":"Subtle variations in the lipid composition of mitochondrial membranes can have a profound impact on mitochondrial function. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains the phospholipid cardiolipin, which has been demonstrated to act as a biomarker for a number of diverse pathologies. Small molecule dyes capable of selectively partitioning into cardiolipin membranes enable visualization and quantification of the cardiolipin content. Here we present a data-driven approach that combines a deep learning-enabled active learning workflow with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and alchemical free energy calculations to discover small organic compounds able to selectively permeate cardiolipin-containing membranes. By employing transferable coarse-grained models we efficiently navigate the all-atom design space corresponding to small organic molecules with molecular weight less than \u2248500 Da. After direct simulation of only 0.42% of our coarse-grained search space we identify molecules with considerably increased levels of cardiolipin selectivity compared to a widely used cardiolipin probe 10-N-nonyl acridine orange. Our accumulated simulation data enables us to derive interpretable design rules linking coarse-grained structure to cardiolipin selectivity. The findings are corroborated by fluorescence anisotropy measurements of two compounds conforming to our defined design rules. Our findings highlight the potential of coarse-grained representations and multiscale modelling for materials discovery and design.","8":"Lipid asymmetry in plasma membrane of eukaryotes is ubiquitous. The first measurements reported compositional asymmetry: phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine are mostly on the cytoplasmic leafet, while phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin are mostly on the exoplasmic leaflet. More recent experiments using lipidomics have evidenced the presence of saturation asymmetry between the two leaflets. A question that naturally arises is why such an asymmetry? To complicate matters, it is still largely unknown in which leaflet cholesterol lies. Here, we use chemical potentials to mimic flippase proteins responsible for maintenance of compositional asymmetry in silico. We show that saturation asymmetry naturally arises as a byproduct of phospholipid number asymmetry and sphingomyelin contents, thereby showing that some reported asymmetries may naturally result from others and do not necessarily require being externally driven. We also show that plasmalogen lipids\u2019 tendency to be highly unsaturated is also natural. Additionally, we tackle the problem of cholesterol and show that, while it is influenced by all asymmetries, the resulting cholesterol asymmetry tends to be fairly mild.","9":"The dynamics and spectroscopy of N-methyl-acetamide (NMA) and trialanine in solution are characterized from molecular dynamics simulations using different energy functions, including a conventional point charge (PC)-based force field, one based on a multipolar (MTP) representation of the electrostatics, and a semiempirical DFT method. For the 1D infrared spectra, the frequency splitting between the two amide-I groups is 10 cm-1 from the PC, 13 cm-1 from the MTP, and 47 cm-1 from self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) simulations, compared with 25 cm-1 from experiment. The frequency trajectory required for the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF) is determined from individual normal mode (INM) and full normal mode (FNM) analyses of the amide-I vibrations. The spectroscopy, time-zero magnitude of the FFCF C(t = 0), and the static component \u039402 from simulations using MTP and analysis based on FNM are all consistent with experiments for (Ala)3. Contrary to this, for the analysis excluding mode-mode coupling (INM), the FFCF decays to zero too rapidly and for simulations with a PC-based force field, the \u039402 is too small by a factor of two compared with experiments. Simulations with SCC-DFTB agree better with experiment for these observables than those from PC-based simulations. The conformational ensemble sampled from simulations using PCs is consistent with the literature (including PII, \u03b2, \u03b1R, and \u03b1L), whereas that covered by the MTP-based simulations is dominated by PII with some contributions from \u03b2 and \u03b1R. This agrees with and confirms recently reported Bayesian-refined populations based on 1D infrared experiments. FNM analysis together with a MTP representation provides a meaningful model to correctly describe the dynamics of hydrated trialanine.","10":"","11":"Drug efficacy depends on its capacity to permeate across the cell membrane. We consider the prediction of passive drug-membrane permeability coefficients. Beyond the widely recognized correlation with hydrophobicity, we additionally consider the functional relationship between passive permeation and acidity. To discover easily interpretable equations that explain the data well, we use the recently proposed sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), an artificial-intelligence technique that combines symbolic regression with compressed sensing. Our study is based on a large in silico dataset of 0.4 \u00d7 106 small molecules extracted from coarse-grained simulations. We rationalize the equation suggested by SISSO via an analysis of the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model in several asymptotic acidity regimes. We further extend our analysis to the dependence on lipid-membrane composition. Lipid-tail unsaturation plays a key role but surprisingly contributes stepwise rather than proportionally. Our results are in line with previously observed changes in permeability, suggesting the distinction between liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered permeation. Together, compressed sensing with analytically derived asymptotes establish and validate an accurate, broadly applicable, and interpretable equation for passive permeability across both drug and lipid-tail chemistry.","12":"Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) stand out among molecular liquids for their rich physicochemical characteristics, including structural and dynamic heterogeneity. The significance of electrostatic interactions in RTILs results in long characteristic length- and timescales, and has motivated the development of a number of coarse-grained (CG) simulation models. In this study, we aim to better understand the connection between certain CG parameterization strategies and the dynamical properties and transferability of the resulting models. We systematically compare five CG models: a model largely parameterized from experimental thermodynamic observables; a refinement of this model to increase its structural accuracy; and three models that reproduce a given set of structural distribution functions by construction, with varying intramolecular parameterizations and reference temperatures. All five CG models display limited structural transferability over temperature, and also result in various effective dynamical speedup factors, relative to a reference atomistic model. On the other hand, the structure-based CG models tend to result in more consistent cation\u2013anion relative diffusion than the thermodynamic-based models, for a single thermodynamic state point. By linking short- and long-timescale dynamical behaviors, we demonstrate that the varying dynamical properties of the different CG models can be largely collapsed onto a single curve, which provides evidence for a route to constructing dynamically-consistent CG models of RTILs.","13":"The plasma membrane is the interface between cells and exterior media. Although its existence has been known for a long time, organization of its constituent lipids remain a challenge. Recently, we have proposed that lipid populations may be controlled by chemical potentials of different lipid species, resulting in semigrand canonical thermodynamic ensembles. However, the currently available molecular dynamics software packages do not facilitate the control of chemical potentials at the molecular level. Here, we propose a variation of existing algorithms that efficiently characterizes and controls the chemical nature of each lipid. Additionally, we allow coupling with collective variables and show that it can be used to dynamically create asymmetric membranes. This algorithm is openly available as a plugin for the HOOMD-Blue molecular dynamics engine.","14":"The lipid-raft hypothesis postulates that cell membranes possess some degree of lateral organization. The hypothesis has attracted much attention while remaining controversial, with an underlying mechanism that remains elusive. One idea that supports rafts relies on the membrane lying near a critical point. Although supported by experimental evidence, holding a many-component membrane at criticality requires a delicate tuning of all components\u2014a daunting task. Here, we propose a coherent framework to reconcile critical behavior and lipid regulation. Using a lattice model, we show that lipid regulation of a complex membrane, i.e., allowing composition to fluctuate based on relative chemical potentials, can lead to critical behavior. The results are robust against specific values of the chemical potentials. Instead of a conventional transition point, criticality is observed over a large temperature range. This surprising behavior arises from finite-size effects, causing nonequivalent time and space averages. The instantaneous lipid distribution effectively develops a translational symmetry, which we relate to long-wavelength Goldstone modes. The framework is robust and reproduces important experimental trends; membrane-demixing temperature closely follows cell-growth temperature. It also ensures criticality of fixed-composition extracts, such as giant plasma membrane vesicles. Our clear picture provides a strong argument in favor of the critical-membrane hypothesis, without the need for specific sensing mechanisms.","15":"Computer simulations generate microscopic trajectories of complex systems at a single thermodynamic state point. We recently introduced a Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) approach for dynamical reweighting. Our approach mapped these trajectories to a Markovian description on the configurational coordinates and reweighted path probabilities as a function of external forces. Trajectory probabilities can be dynamically reweighted both from and to equilibrium or non-equilibrium steady states. As the system's dimensionality increases, an exhaustive description of the microtrajectories becomes prohibitive-even with a Markovian assumption. Instead, we reduce the dimensionality of the configurational space to collective variables (CVs). Going from configurational to CV space, we define local entropy productions derived from configurationally averaged mean forces. The entropy production is shown to be a suitable constraint on MaxCal for non-equilibrium steady states expressed as a function of CVs. We test the reweighting procedure on two systems: a particle subject to a two-dimensional potential and a coarse-grained peptide. Our CV-based MaxCal approach expands dynamical reweighting to larger systems, for both static and dynamical properties, and across a large range of driving forces.","16":"The hydrophobic tails of aliphatic primary alcohols do insert into the hydrophobic core of a lipid bilayer. Thereby, they disrupt hydrophobic interactions between the lipid molecules, resulting in a decreased lipid order, i.e., an increased membrane fluidity. While aromatic alcohols, such as 2-phenylethanol, also insert into lipid bilayers and disturb the membrane organization, the impact of aromatic alcohols on the structure of biological membranes, as well as the potential physiological implication of membrane incorporation has only been studied to a limited extent. Although diverse targets are discussed to be causing the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of 2-phenylethanol, it is clear that 2-phenylethanol severely affects the structure of biomembranes, which has been linked to its bacteriostatic activity. Yet, in fungi some 2-phenylethanol derivatives are also produced, some of which appear to also have bacteriostatic activities. We showed that the 2-phenylethanol derivatives phenylacetic acid, phenyllactic acid, and methyl phenylacetate, but not Tyrosol, were fully incorporated into model membranes and affected the membrane organization. Furthermore, we observed that the propensity of the herein-analyzed molecules to partition into biomembranes positively correlated with their respective bacteriostatic activity, which clearly linked the bacteriotoxic activity of the substances to biomembranes.","17":"Switching between different levels of resolution is essential for multiscale modeling, but restoring details at higher resolution remains challenging. In our previous study, we have introduced deepBackmap, a deep neural-network-based approach to reverse-map equilibrated molecular structures for condensed-phase systems. Our method combines data-driven and physics-based aspects, leading to high-quality reconstructed structures. In this work, we expand the scope of our model and examine its chemical transferability. To this end, we train deepBackmap solely on homogeneous molecular liquids of small molecules and apply it to a more challenging polymer melt. We augment the generator\u2019s objective with different force-field-based terms as a prior to regularize the results. The best performing physical prior depends on whether we train for a specific chemistry or transfer our model. Our local environment representation combined with the sequential reconstruction of fine-grained structures helps in reaching transferability of the learned correlations.","18":"Decades of hardware, methodological, and algorithmic development have propelled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to the forefront of materials-modeling techniques, bridging the gap between electronic-structure theory and continuum methods. The physics-based approach makes MD appropriate to study emergent phenomena, but simultaneously incurs significant computational investment. This topical review explores the use of MD outside the scope of individual systems, but rather considering many compounds. Such an in silico screening approach makes MD amenable to establishing coveted structure-property relationships. We specifically focus on biomolecules and soft materials, characterized by the significant role of entropic contributions and heterogeneous systems and scales. An account of the state of the art for the implementation of an MD-based screening paradigm is described, including automated force-field parametrization, system preparation, and efficient sampling across both conformation and composition. Emphasis is placed on machine-learning methods to enable MD-based screening. The resulting framework enables the generation of compound-property databases and the use of advanced statistical modeling to gather insight. The review further summarizes a number of relevant applications.","19":"Coarse-grained (CG) conformational surface hopping (SH) adapts the concept of multisurface dynamics, initially developed to describe electronic transitions in chemical reactions, to accurately describe classical molecular dynamics at a reduced level. The SH scheme couples distinct conformational basins (states), each described by its own force field (surface), resulting in a significant improvement of the approximation to the many-body potential of mean force [T. Bereau and J. F. Rudzinski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 256002 (2018)]. The present study first describes CG SH in more detail, through both a toy model and a three-bead model of hexane. We further extend the methodology to non-bonded interactions and report its impact on liquid properties. Finally, we investigate the transferability of the surfaces to distinct systems and thermodynamic state points, through a simple tuning of the state probabilities. In particular, applications to variations in temperature and chemical composition show good agreement with reference atomistic calculations, introducing a promising \"weak-transferability regime,\" where CG force fields can be shared across thermodynamic and chemical neighborhoods.","20":"A tight and consistent link between resolutions is crucial to further expand the impact of multiscale modeling for complex materials. We herein tackle the generation of condensed molecular structures as a refinement\u2014backmapping\u2014of a coarse-grained (CG) structure. Traditional schemes start from a rough coarse-to-fine mapping and perform further energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations to equilibrate the system. In this study we introduce DeepBackmap: A deep neural network based approach to directly predict equilibrated molecular structures for condensed-phase systems. We use generative adversarial networks to learn the Boltzmann distribution from training data and realize reverse mapping by using the CG structure as a conditional input. We apply our method to a challenging condensed-phase polymeric system. We observe that the model trained in a melt has remarkable transferability to the crystalline phase. The combination of data-driven and physics-based aspects of our architecture help reach temperature transferability with only limited training data.","21":"Cell membranes mainly consist of lipid bilayers with an actively regulated composition. The underlying processes are still poorly understood, in particular, how the hundreds of components are controlled. Cholesterol has been found to correlate with phospholipid saturation for reasons that remain unclear. To better understand the link between cell membrane regulation and chemical composition, we establish a computational framework based on chemical reaction networks, resulting in multiple semigrand canonical ensembles. By running computer simulations, we show that regulating the chemical potential of lipid species is sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed increase in acyl tail saturation with added cholesterol. Our model proposes a different picture of lipid regulation in which components can be regulated passively instead of actively. In this picture, phospholipid acyl tail composition naturally adapts to added molecules such as cholesterol or proteins. A comparison between regulated membranes with commonly studied ternary model membranes shows stark differences: for instance, correlation lengths and viscosities observed are independent of lipid chemical affinity.","22":"We consider the prediction of a basic thermodynamic property-hydration free energies-across a large subset of the chemical space of small organic molecules. Our in silico study is based on computer simulations at the atomistic level with implicit solvent. We report on a kernel-based machine learning approach that is inspired by recent work in learning electronic properties but differs in key aspects: The representation is averaged over several conformers to account for the statistical ensemble. We also include an atomic-decomposition ansatz, which offers significant added transferability compared to molecular learning. Finally, we explore the existence of severe biases from databases of experimental compounds. By performing a combination of dimensionality reduction and cross-learning models, we show that the rate of learning depends significantly on the breadth and variety of the training dataset. Our study highlights the dangers of fitting machine-learning models to databases of a narrow chemical range.","23":"Designing advanced membrane materials with machine-assisted learning. The field of polymer membrane design is primarily based on empirical observation, which limits discovery of new materials optimized for separating a given gas pair. Instead of relying on exhaustive experimental investigations, we trained a machine learning (ML) algorithm, using a topological, path-based hash of the polymer repeating unit. We used a limited set of experimental gas permeability data for six different gases in ~700 polymeric constructs that have been measured to date to predict the gas-separation behavior of over 11,000 homopolymers not previously tested for these properties. To test the algorithm\u2019s accuracy, we synthesized two of the most promising polymer membranes predicted by this approach and found that they exceeded the upper bound for CO2\/CH4 separation performance. This ML technique, which is trained using a relatively small body of experimental data (and no simulation data), evidently represents an innovative means of exploring the vast phase space available for polymer membrane design.","24":"Current machine learning (ML) models aimed at learning force fields are plagued by their high computational cost at every integration time step. We describe a number of practical and computationally efficient strategies to parametrize traditional force fields for molecular liquids from ML: the particle decomposition ansatz to two- and three-body force fields, the use of kernel-based ML models that incorporate physical symmetries, the incorporation of switching functions close to the cutoff, and the use of covariant meshing to boost the training set size. Results are presented for model molecular liquids: pairwise Lennard-Jones, three-body Stillinger\u2013Weber, and bottom-up coarse-graining of water. Here, covariant meshing proves to be an efficient strategy to learn canonically averaged instantaneous forces. We show that molecular dynamics simulations with tabulated two- and three-body ML potentials are computationally efficient and recover two- and three-body distribution functions. Many-body representations, decomposition, and kernel regression schemes are all implemented in the open-source software package VOTCA.","25":"Extracting insight from the enormous quantity of data generated from molecular simulations requires the identification of a small number of collective variables whose corresponding low-dimensional free-energy landscape retains the essential features of the underlying system. Data-driven techniques provide a systematic route to constructing this landscape, without the need for extensive a priori intuition into the relevant driving forces. In particular, autoencoders are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, as they naturally force an information bottleneck and, thereby, a low-dimensional embedding of the essential features. While variational autoencoders ensure continuity of the embedding by assuming a unimodal Gaussian prior, this is at odds with the multi-basin free-energy landscapes that typically arise from the identification of meaningful collective variables. In this work, we incorporate this physical intuition into the prior by employing a Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE), which encourages the separation of metastable states within the embedding. The GMVAE performs dimensionality reduction and clustering within a single unified framework, and is capable of identifying the inherent dimensionality of the input data, in terms of the number of Gaussians required to categorize the data. We illustrate our approach on two toy models, alanine dipeptide, and a challenging disordered peptide ensemble, demonstrating the enhanced clustering effect of the GMVAE prior compared to standard VAEs. The resulting embeddings appear to be promising representations for constructing Markov state models, highlighting the transferability of the dimensionality reduction from static equilibrium properties to dynamics.","26":"Small solutes have been shown to alter the lateral organization of cell membranes and reconstituted phospholipid bilayers; however, the mechanisms by which these changes happen are still largely unknown. Traditionally, both experiment and simulation studies have been restricted to testing only a few compounds at a time, failing to identify general molecular descriptors or chemical properties that would allow extrapolating beyond the subset of considered solutes. In this work, we probe the competing energetics of inserting a solute in different membrane environments by means of the potential of mean force. We show that these calculations can be used as a computationally efficient proxy to establish whether a solute will stabilize or destabilize domain phase separation. Combined with umbrella-sampling simulations and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to screen solutes across a wide range of chemistries and polarities. Our results indicate that for the system under consideration, preferential partitioning and therefore effectiveness in altering membrane phase separation are strictly linked to the location of insertion in the bilayer (i.e., midplane or interface). Our approach represents a fast and simple tool for obtaining structural and thermodynamic insight into the partitioning of small molecules between lipid domains and its relation to phase separation, ultimately providing a platform for identifying the key determinants of this process.","27":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The permeation of small-molecule drugs across a phospholipid membrane bears much interest both in the pharmaceutical sciences and in physical chemistry. Connecting the chemistry of the drug and the lipids to the resulting thermodynamic properties remains of immediate importance. Here we report molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories using the coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field. A wide, representative coverage of chemistry is provided: across solutes\u2014exhaustively enumerating all 105 CG dimers\u2014and across six phospholipids. For each combination, umbrella-sampling simulations provide detailed structural information of the solute at all depths from the bilayer midplane to bulk water, allowing a precise reconstruction of the potential of mean force. Overall, the present database contains trajectories from 15,120 MD simulations. This database may serve the further identification of structure-property relationships between compound chemistry and drug permeability.<\/jats:p>","28":"Understanding the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and boundaries of cells is crucial both for their toxicity and therapeutic applications. Besides specific receptor-mediated endocytosis of surface-functionalized NPs, passive internalization is prompted by relatively unspecific parameters, such as particle size and charge. Based on theoretical treatments, adhesion to and bending of the cell membrane can induce NP wrapping. Experimentally, powerful tools are needed to selectively probe possible membrane-NP motifs at very dilute conditions and avoid dye labeling. In this work, we employ surface resonance-enhanced dynamic light scattering, surface plasmon resonance, electron microscopy, and simulations for sensing interactions between plasmonic AuNPs and polymersomes. We distinguish three different interaction scenarios at nanomolar concentrations by tuning the surface charge of AuNPs and rationalize these events by balancing vesicle bending and electrostatic\/van der Waals AuNP and vesicle adhesion. The clarification of the physical conditions under which nanoparticles passively translocate across membranes can aid in the rational design of drugs that cannot exploit specific modes of cellular uptake and also elucidates physical properties that render nanoparticles in the environment particularly toxic.","29":"Polymorphism rationalizes how processing can control the final structure of a material. The rugged free-energy landscape and exceedingly slow kinetics in the solid state have so far hampered computational investigations. We report for the first time the free-energy landscape of a polymorphic crystalline polymer, syndiotactic polystyrene. Coarse-grained metadynamics simulations allow us to efficiently sample the landscape at large. The free-energy difference between the two main polymorphs, \u03b1 and \u03b2, is further investigated by quantum-chemical calculations. The results of the two methods are in line with experimental observations: they predict \u03b2 as the more stable polymorph under standard conditions. Critically, the free-energy landscape suggests how the \u03b1 polymorph may lead to experimentally observed kinetic traps. The combination of multiscale modeling, enhanced sampling, and quantum-chemical calculations offers an appealing strategy to uncover complex free-energy landscapes with polymorphic behavior.","30":"Coarse-grained (CG) models are often parameterized to reproduce one-dimensional structural correlation functions of an atomically detailed model along the degrees of freedom governing each interaction potential. While cross correlations between these degrees of freedom inform the optimal set of interaction parameters, the correlations generated from the higher-resolution simulations are often too complex to act as an accurate proxy for the CG correlations. Instead, the most popular methods determine the interaction parameters iteratively while assuming that individual interactions are uncorrelated. While these iterative methods have been validated for a wide range of systems, they also have disadvantages when parameterizing models for multicomponent systems or when refining previously established models to better reproduce particular structural features. In this work, we propose two distinct approaches for the direct (i.e., noniterative) parameterization of a CG model by adjusting the high-resolution cross correlations of an atomistic model in order to more accurately reflect correlations that will be generated by the resulting CG model. The derived models more accurately describe the low-order structural features of the underlying AA model while necessarily generating inherently distinct cross correlations compared with the atomically detailed reference model. We demonstrate the proposed methods for a one-site-per-molecule representation of liquid water, where pairwise interactions are incapable of reproducing the true tetrahedral solvation structure. We then investigate the precise role that distinct cross-correlation features play in determining the correct pair correlation functions, evaluating the importance of the placement of correlation features as well as the balance between features appearing in different solvation shells.","31":"Computer simulations generate trajectories at a single, well-defined thermodynamic state point. Statistical reweighting offers the means to reweight static and dynamical properties to different equilibrium state points by means of analytic relations. We extend these ideas to nonequilibrium steady states by relying on a maximum path entropy formalism subject to physical constraints. Stochastic thermodynamics analytically relates the forward and backward probabilities of any pathway through the external nonconservative force, enabling reweighting both in and out of equilibrium. We avoid the combinatorial explosion of microtrajectories by systematically constructing pathways through Markovian transitions. We further identify a quantity that is invariant to dynamical reweighting, analogous to the density of states in equilibrium reweighting.","32":"Increasing the efficiency of materials design remains a significant challenge given the large size of chemical compound space (CCS). The use of a chemically transferable coarse-grained model enables different molecular fragments to map to the same bead type, significantly increasing screening efficiency. Here, we propose new criteria for the design of coarse-grained models allowing for the optimization of their chemical transferability and evaluate the Martini model within this framework. We further investigate the scope of this transferability by parameterizing three Martini-like models in which the number of bead types ranges from 5 to 16. These force fields are fully compatible with existing Martini environments because they are parameterized by interpolating the Martini interaction matrix. We then implement a Bayesian approach to determining which chemical groups are likely to be present on fragments corresponding to specific bead types for each model. We demonstrate that a level of accuracy comparable to Martini is obtained with a force field with fewer bead types, using the water\/octanol partitioning free energy (\u0394GW\u2192Ol) as our metric for comparison. However, the advantage of including more bead types is a reduction of uncertainty when back-mapping these bead types to specific chemistries. Just as reducing the size of the coarse-grained particles leads to a finer mapping of conformational space, increasing the number of bead types yields a finer mapping of CCS. Finally, we note that, due to the large size of fragments mapping to a single Martini bead, a resolution limit arises when using \u0394GW\u2192Ol as the only descriptor when coarse-graining CCS.","33":"ABSTRACT Assessing the permeation rate of drug-like molecules across a lipid membrane is of paramount importance for pharmaceutical applications. While the Meyer-Overton rule relates the permeability coefficient to a few thermodynamic properties, its accuracy is limited by the homogeneity assumption. In this work, we extract an analogous relation for the permeation of a small solute through a lipid bilayer. This is obtained by systematically screening a subset of chemical space by means of high-throughput coarse-grained simulations, and relying on the accurate inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model (ISDM). We connect the permeability coefficient of a compound to two molecular descriptors: partitioning free-energy and acid dissociation constant. In the ISDM the permeability is a functional of the potential of mean force. We discuss how \u2013 and when \u2013 combining together these profiles for a large variety of compounds can result in a smooth dependence of the permeability on the molecular descriptors. We focus on acidic molecules: for weak acids, the permeability largely depends on the main free-energy differences of the problem, which directly link to our molecular descriptors. For strong acids, the multivalued nature of the permeability requires to introduce a third variable, characterising the amphiphilicity of the small molecule.

This leads high-throughput protocols to drastically subsample and results in sparse and nonuniform datasets. Rather than arbitrarily selecting compounds, we systematically explore chemical space according to the target property of interest. We first perform importance sampling by introducing a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme across compounds. We then train a machine learning (ML) model on the sampled data to expand the region of chemical space probed. Our boosting procedure enhances the number of compounds by a factor 2 to 10, enabled by the ML model's coarse-grained representation, which both simplifies the structure-property relationship and reduces the size of chemical space. The ML model correctly recovers linear relationships between transfer free energies. These linear relationships correspond to features that are global to the dataset, marking the region of chemical space up to which predictions are reliable; this is a more robust alternative to the predictive variance. Bridging coarse-grained simulations with ML gives rise to an unprecedented database of drug-membrane insertion free energies for 1.3 million compounds.","35":"Polydispersity and random sequences are ubiquitous features of polymers, and molecular dynamics simulations can help elucidate the impact of disorder in polymer systems. However, currently available packages for building polymer topologies do not enable the user to include randomness in a straightforward fashion. Here, we introduce Hoobas, a molecular builder package that easily handles polydispersity using a prototype-builder design pattern. This enables fast and easy building of systems comprised of thousands of distinct objects. It is written in the Python programming language, which ensures compatibility with a wide range of molecular dynamics packages and tools, as well as easy integration into most workflows.","36":"There is an urgent need for biomaterials that support tissue healing, particularly neuronal regeneration. In a medium throughput screen novel self\u2010assembling peptide (SAP) sequences that form fibrils and stimulated nerve fiber growth of peripheral nervous system (PNS)\u2010derived neurons are identified. Based on the peptide sequences and fibril morphologies and by applying rational data\u2010mining, important structural parameters stimulating neuronal activity are elucidated. Three SAPs (SAP1e, SAP2e, and SAP5c) enhance adhesion and growth of PNS neurons. These SAPs form 2D and 3D matrices that serve as bioactive scaffolds stimulating cell adhesion and growth. The newly discovered SAPs also support the growth of CNS neurons and glia cells. Subsequently, the potential of SAPs to enhance PNS regeneration in vivo is analyzed. For this, the facial nerve driving whisker movement in mice is injured. Notably, SAPs persist for up to 3 weeks in the injury site indicating highly adhesive properties and stability. After SAP administration, more motor neurons incorporating markers for successive regeneration are observed. Recovery of whisker movement is elevated in SAP\u2010injected mice. In summary, short peptides that form fibrils are identified and the adhesion, growth, and regeneration of neurons have been efficiently enhanced without the necessity to attach hormones or growth factors.","37":"Unraveling the relation between the chemical structure of small druglike compounds and their rate of passive permeation across lipid membranes is of fundamental importance for pharmaceutical applications. The elucidation of a comprehensive structure\u2013permeability relationship expressed in terms of a few molecular descriptors is unfortunately hampered by the overwhelming number of possible compounds. In this work, we reduce a priori the size and diversity of chemical space to solve an analogous\u2014but smoothed out\u2014structure\u2013property relationship problem. This is achieved by relying on a physics-based coarse-grained model that reduces the size of chemical space, enabling a comprehensive exploration of this space with greatly reduced computational cost. We perform high-throughput coarse-grained (HTCG) simulations to derive a permeability surface in terms of two simple molecular descriptors\u2014bulk partitioning free energy and pKa. The surface is constructed by exhaustively simulating all coarse-grained compounds that are representative of small organic molecules (ranging from 30 to 160 Da) in a high-throughput scheme. We provide results for acidic, basic, and zwitterionic compounds. Connecting back to the atomic resolution, the HTCG predictions for more than 500\u202f000 compounds allow us to establish a clear connection between specific chemical groups and the resulting permeability coefficient, enabling for the first time an inverse design procedure. Our results have profound implications for drug synthesis: the predominance of commonly employed chemical moieties narrows down the range of permeabilities.","38":"Discrete-space kinetic models, i.e., Markov state models, have emerged as powerful tools for reducing the complexity of trajectories generated from molecular dynamics simulations. These models require configuration-space representations that accurately characterize the relevant dynamics. Well-established, low-dimensional order parameters for constructing this representation have led to widespread application of Markov state models to study conformational dynamics in biomolecular systems. On the contrary, applications to characterize single-molecule diffusion processes have been scarce and typically employ system-specific, higher-dimensional order parameters to characterize the local solvation state of the molecule. In this work, we propose an automated method for generating a coarse configuration-space representation, using generic features of the solvation structure-the coordination numbers about each particle. To overcome the inherent noisy behavior of these low-dimensional observables, we treat the features as indicators of an underlying, latent Markov process. The resulting hidden Markov models filter the trajectories of each feature into the most likely latent solvation state at each time step. The filtered trajectories are then used to construct a configuration-space discretization, which accurately describes the diffusion kinetics. The method is validated on a standard model for glassy liquids, where particle jumps between local cages determine the diffusion properties of the system. Not only do the resulting models provide quantitatively accurate characterizations of the diffusion constant, but they also reveal a mechanistic description of diffusive jumps, quantifying the heterogeneity of local diffusion.","39":"Abstract Once materials come into contact with a biological fluid containing proteins, proteins are generally\u2014whether desired or not\u2014attracted by the material's surface and adsorb onto it. The aim of this Review is to give an overview of the most commonly used characterization methods employed to gain a better understanding of the adsorption processes on either planar or curved surfaces. We continue to illustrate the benefit of combining different methods to different surface geometries of the material. The thus obtained insight ideally paves the way for engineering functional materials that interact with proteins in a predetermined manner.","40":"Syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) exhibits complex polymorphic behavior upon crystallization. Computational modeling of polymer crystallization has remained a challenging task because the relevant processes are slow on the molecular time scale. A detailed characterization of sPS\u2010crystal polymorphism by means of coarse\u2010grained (CG) and atomistic (AA) modeling is reported herein. The CG model, parametrized in the melt, shows remarkable transferability properties in the crystalline phase. Not only is the transition temperature in good agreement with atomistic simulations, it stabilizes the main \u03b1 and \u03b2 polymorphs, observed experimentally. The propensities of polymorphs at the CG and AA levels are compared in detail, as well as finite\u2010size and box\u2010geometry effects. All in all, CG modeling stands as an efficient approach to characterize polymer\u2010crystal poymorphism at large scale.","41":"Classical intermolecular potentials typically require an extensive parametrization procedure for any new compound considered. To do away with prior parametrization, we propose a combination of physics-based potentials with machine learning (ML), coined IPML, which is transferable across small neutral organic and biologically relevant molecules. ML models provide on-the-fly predictions for environment-dependent local atomic properties: electrostatic multipole coefficients (significant error reduction compared to previously reported), the population and decay rate of valence atomic densities, and polarizabilities across conformations and chemical compositions of H, C, N, and O atoms. These parameters enable accurate calculations of intermolecular contributions-electrostatics, charge penetration, repulsion, induction\/polarization, and many-body dispersion. Unlike other potentials, this model is transferable in its ability to handle new molecules and conformations without explicit prior parametrization: All local atomic properties are predicted from ML, leaving only eight global parameters-optimized once and for all across compounds. We validate IPML on various gas-phase dimers at and away from equilibrium separation, where we obtain mean absolute errors between 0.4 and 0.7 kcal\/mol for several chemically and conformationally diverse datasets representative of non-covalent interactions in biologically relevant molecules. We further focus on hydrogen-bonded complexes-essential but challenging due to their directional nature-where datasets of DNA base pairs and amino acids yield an extremely encouraging 1.4 kcal\/mol error. Finally, and as a first look, we consider IPML for denser systems: water clusters, supramolecular host-guest complexes, and the benzene crystal.","42":"Coarse-grained molecular simulation models have provided immense, often general, insight into the complex behavior of condensed-phase systems but suffer from a lost connection to the true dynamical properties of the underlying system. In general, the physics that is built into a model shapes the free-energy landscape, restricting the attainable static and kinetic properties. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into the property interrelationships resulting from these restrictions, for a representative system of the helix-coil transition. Inspired by high-throughput studies, we systematically vary force-field parameters and monitor their structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. The focus of our investigation is a simple coarse-grained model, which accurately represents the underlying structural ensemble, i.e., effectively avoids sterically-forbidden configurations. As a result of this built-in physics, we observe a rather large restriction in the topology of the networks characterizing the simulation kinetics. When screening across force-field parameters, we find that structurally accurate models also best reproduce the kinetics, suggesting structural-kinetic relationships for these models. Additionally, an investigation into thermodynamic properties reveals a link between the cooperativity of the transition and the network topology at a single reference temperature.","43":"The determination of potentials of mean force for solute insertion in a lipid membrane by means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is often hampered by sampling issues. Recently, a multiscale method has been proposed to leverage the conformational ensemble of a lower-resolution model as starting point for higher resolution simulations. In this work, we analyze the efficiency of this method by comparing its predictions for propanol insertion into a lipid membrane against conventional atomistic umbrella sampling simulation results. The multiscale approach is confirmed to provide accurate results with a gain of one order of magnitude in computational time. We then investigate the role of the coarse-grained representation. We find that the accuracy of the results is tightly connected to the presence of a good configurational overlap between the coarse-grained and atomistic models\u2014a general requirement when developing multiscale simulation methods.","44":"<jats:p>Coarse-grained molecular simulation models can provide significant insight into the complex behavior of protein systems, but suffer from an inherently distorted description of dynamical properties. We recently demonstrated that, for a heptapeptide of alanine residues, the structural and kinetic properties of a simulation model are linked in a rather simple way, given a certain level of physics present in the model. In this work, we extend these findings to a longer peptide, for which the representation of configuration space in terms of a full enumeration of sequences of helical\/coil states along the peptide backbone is impractical. We verify the structural-kinetic relationships by scanning the parameter space of a simple native-biased model and then employ a distinct transferable model to validate and generalize the conclusions. Our results further demonstrate the validity of the previous findings, while clarifying the role of conformational entropy in the determination of the structural-kinetic relationships. More specifically, while the global, long timescale kinetic properties of a particular class of models with varying energetic parameters but approximately fixed conformational entropy are determined by the overarching structural features of the ensemble, a shift in these kinetic observables occurs for models with a distinct representation of steric interactions. At the same time, the relationship between structure and more local, faster kinetic properties is not affected by varying the conformational entropy of the model.<\/jats:p>","45":"Classical molecular dynamics strategies are inherently limited by the molecular-mechanics basis set employed. Here we extend the concept of multisurface dynamics, initially developed to describe electronic transitions in chemical reactions, to sample the conformational ensemble of a classical system in equilibrium. In analogy to describing different electronic configurations, a surface-hopping scheme couples distinct conformational basins. A structural criterion for the surface selection effectively introduces coupling beyond the additivity of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the method through a systematic coarse-graining of two molecular systems that give rise to notoriously challenging many-body potentials of mean force. Incorporating more surfaces leads systematically towards unimodal distributions within each basin, resulting in structural improvements that also yield kinetic consistency.","46":"The partitioning of small molecules in cell membranes-a key parameter for pharmaceutical applications-typically relies on experimentally available bulk partitioning coefficients. Computer simulations provide a structural resolution of the insertion thermodynamics via the potential of mean force but require significant sampling at the atomistic level. Here, we introduce high-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to screen thermodynamic properties. This application of physics-based models in a large-scale study of small molecules establishes linear relationships between partitioning coefficients and key features of the potential of mean force. This allows us to predict the structure of the insertion from bulk experimental measurements for more than 400 000 compounds. The potential of mean force hereby becomes an easily accessible quantity-already recognized for its high predictability of certain properties, e.g., passive permeation. Further, we demonstrate how coarse graining helps reduce the size of chemical space, enabling a hierarchical approach to screening small molecules.","47":"Nitrated fatty acids (NO2 -FAs) act as anti-inflammatory signal mediators, albeit the molecular mechanisms behind NO2 -FAs' influence on diverse metabolic and signaling pathways in inflamed tissues are essentially elusive. Here, we combine fluorescence measurements with surface-specific sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and coarse-grained computer simulations to demonstrate that NO2 -FAs alter lipid organization by accumulation at the membrane-water interface. As the function of membrane proteins strongly depends on both, protein structure as well as membrane properties, we consecutively follow the structural dynamics of an integral membrane protein in presence of NO2 -FAs. Based on our results, we suggest a molecular mechanism of the NO2 -FA in vivo activity: Driven by the NO2 -FA-induced lipid layer reorganization, the structure and function of membrane-associated (signaling) proteins is indirectly affected.","48":"The paradox of biomimetic research is to perform bio-functionality, usually associated with sophisticated structures optimized by nature, with minimal structural complexity for the ease of fabrication. Here we show that a three-particle trimer can exhibit kinesin-like autonomous walk on a track via reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The autonomous motion is due to imbalanced transitions resulting from exothermic catalytic reactions, and the spatial asymmetry from the track. This molecular design can be realized by reproducing the particle\u2013particle interactions in functionalized nano- or colloidal particles. Our results open up the possibility of fabricating bio-mimetic nano-systems in a minimalist approach.","49":"The parametrization of coarse-grained (CG) simulation models for molecular systems often aims at reproducing static properties alone. The reduced molecular friction of the CG representation usually results in faster, albeit inconsistent, dynamics. In this work, we rely on Markov state models to simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide force fields\u2014one top-down and one bottom-up. Instead of a rigorous evolution of CG dynamics (e.g., using a generalized Langevin equation), we attempt to improve the description of kinetics by simply altering the existing CG models, which employ standard Langevin dynamics. By varying masses and relevant force-field parameters, we can improve the timescale separation of the slow kinetic processes, achieve a more consistent ratio of mean-first-passage times between metastable states, and refine the relative free-energies between these states. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of kinetic information into a structure-based parametrization improves the description of the helix-coil transition sampled by a minimal CG model. While structure-based models understabilize the helical state, kinetic constraints help identify CG models that improve the ratio of forward\/backward timescales by effectively hindering the sampling of spurious conformational intermediate states.","50":"Halogenation is one of the cases for which advanced molecular simulation methods are mandatory for quantitative and predictive studies. The present work provides a systematic investigation of the importance of higher-order multipoles on specific sites of halobenzenes, other than the halogen, for static and dynamic properties in condensed-phase simulations. For that purpose, solute-solvent interactions using point charge (PC), multipole (MTP), and hybrid point charge\/multipole (HYB) electrostatic models are analyzed in regions of halogen bonding and extended to regions of \u03c0 orbitals of phenyl carbons. Using molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical methods, it is found that the sigma-hole does not only affect the halogen and the carbon bound to it but its effect extends to the carbons adjacent to the CX bond. This effect increases with the magnitude of the positive potential of the sigma-hole. With the MTP and HYB3 models, all hydration free energies of the PhX compounds are reproduced within 0.1 kcal\/mol. Analysis of pair distribution functions and hydration free energies of halogenated benzenes provides a microscopic explanation why \"point charge\"-based representations with off-site charges fail in reproducing thermodynamic properties of the sigma-hole. Application of the hybrid models to study protein-ligand binding demonstrates both their accuracy and computational efficiency.","51":"Soft matter embodies a wide range of materials, which all share the common characteristics of weak interaction energies determining their supramolecular structure. This complicates structure-property predictions and hampers the direct application of data-driven approaches to their modeling. We present several aspects in which these methods play a role in designing soft-matter materials: drug design as well as information-driven computer simulations, e.g., histogram reweighting. We also discuss recent examples of rational design of soft-matter materials fostered by physical insight and assisted by data-driven approaches. We foresee the combination of data-driven and physical approaches a promising strategy to move the field forward.","52":"The thermodynamics of insertion of a protein in a membrane depends on the fine interplay between backbone and side-chain contributions interacting with the lipid environment. Using computer simulations, we probe how different descriptions of the backbone glycyl unit affect the thermodynamics of insertion of individual residues, dipeptides, and entire transmembrane helices. Due to the lack of reference data, we first introduce an efficient methodology to estimate atomistic potential of mean force (PMF) curves from a series of representative and uncorrelated coarse-grained (CG) snapshots. We find strong discrepancies between two CG models, Martini and PLUM, against reference atomistic PMFs and experiments. Atomistic simulations suggest a weak free energy of insertion between water and a POPC membrane for the glycyl unit, in overall agreement with experimental results despite severe assumptions in our calculations. We show that refining the backbone contribution in PLUM significantly improves the PMF of insertion of the WALP16 transmembrane peptide. An improper balance between the glycyl backbone and the attached side chain will lead to energetic artifacts, rationalizing Martini's overstabilization of WALP's adsorbed interfacial state. It illustrates difficulties associated with free-energy-based parametrizations of single-residue models, as the relevant free energy of partitioning used for force-field parametrization does not arise from the entire residue but rather the solvent-accessible chemical groups.","53":"Molecular simulations can provide microscopic insight into the physical and chemical driving forces of complex molecular processes. Despite continued advancement of simulation methodology, model errors may lead to inconsistencies between simulated and reference (e.g., from experiments or higher-level simulations) observables. To bound the microscopic information generated by computer simulations within reference measurements, we propose a method that reweights the microscopic transitions of the system to improve consistency with a set of coarse kinetic observables. The method employs the well-developed Markov state modeling framework to efficiently link microscopic dynamics with long-time scale constraints, thereby consistently addressing a wide range of time scales. To emphasize the robustness of the method, we consider two distinct coarse-grained models with significant kinetic inconsistencies. When applied to the simulated conformational dynamics of small peptides, the reweighting procedure systematically improves the time scale separation of the slowest processes. Additionally, constraining the forward and backward rates between metastable states leads to slight improvement of their relative stabilities and, thus, refined equilibrium properties of the resulting model. Finally, we find that difficulties in simultaneously describing both the simulated data and the provided constraints can help identify specific limitations of the underlying simulation approach.","54":"The anchor of most integral membrane proteins consists of one or several helices spanning the lipid bilayer. The WALP peptide, GWW(LA)n (L)WWA, is a common model helix to study the fundamentals of protein insertion and folding, as well as helix-helix association in the membrane. Its structural properties have been illuminated in a large number of experimental and simulation studies. In this combined coarse-grained and atomistic simulation study, we probe the thermodynamics of a single WALP peptide, focusing on both the insertion across the water-membrane interface, as well as folding in both water and a membrane. The potential of mean force characterizing the peptide's insertion into the membrane shows qualitatively similar behavior across peptides and three force fields. However, the Martini force field exhibits a pronounced secondary minimum for an adsorbed interfacial state, which may even become the global minimum-in contrast to both atomistic simulations and the alternative PLUM force field. Even though the two coarse-grained models reproduce the free energy of insertion of individual amino acids side chains, they both underestimate its corresponding value for the full peptide (as compared with atomistic simulations), hinting at cooperative physics beyond the residue level. Folding of WALP in the two environments indicates the helix as the most stable structure, though with different relative stabilities and chain-length dependence.","55":"","56":"The solvent dynamics around fluorinated acetonitrile is characterized by 2-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and atomistic simulations. The lineshape of the linear infrared spectrum is better captured by semiempirical (density functional tight binding) mixed quantum mechanical\/molecular mechanics simulations, whereas force field simulations with multipolar interactions yield lineshapes that are significantly too narrow. For the solvent dynamics, a relatively slow time scale of 2 ps is found from the experiments and supported by the mixed quantum mechanical\/molecular mechanics simulations. With multipolar force fields fitted to the available thermodynamical data, the time scale is considerably faster--on the 0.5 ps time scale. The simulations provide evidence for a well established CF-HOH hydrogen bond (population of 25%) which is found from the radial distribution function g(r) from both, force field and quantum mechanics\/molecular mechanics simulations.","57":"The systematic exploration of chemical compound space holds many promises toward structure-function relationships and material design. In the context of computer simulations, progress is hampered by both the sheer number of compounds and the efforts associated with parametrizing a force field for every new molecule. A coarse-grained (CG) representation provides not only a reduced phase space but also a smaller number of compounds, due to the redundancy of CG representations mapping to the same structure. Though many CG models require the explicit force-field parametrization of a molecule with all others, others assume transferability by means of mixing rules, such as the Martini force field. To alleviate the burden associated with tedious parametrizations for each new compound, the present work aims at automating the mapping and parametrization of common small organic molecules for Martini. We test the method by analyzing the water\/octanol partitioning of more than 650 neutral molecules, the hydration free energy of 354 others, and the free energies of hydration and solvation in octanol of another 69 compounds. Last, we compare with all-atom simulations the thermodynamics of insertion of four individual solute molecules in a phospholipid membrane. The protocol demonstrates the feasibility of an automated parametrization scheme for Martini and provides prospects for high-throughput simulation methodologies.","58":"The performance of multipole (MTP) and point charge (PC) force fields in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of condensed-phase systems for both equilibrium and dynamical quantities is compared. MTP electrostatics provides an improved description of the anisotropic electrostatic potential, which is especially important to describe key, challenging interactions, such as lone pairs, \u03c0-interactions, and hydrogen bonds. These chemical environments are probed by focusing on the hydration properties of two molecules: N-methylacetamide and phenyl bromide. Both, equilibrium and dynamical, quantities are affected by the quality of the electrostatic model. The alteration of the first solvation shell in MTP simulations is validated by comparing with lifetimes and correlation times of solute-solvent interactions from experiment. The improved dynamical behavior found in the MTP simulations\u2014observed for molecules parametrized using very different protocols\u2014suggests that a systematic improvement of both equilibrium and dynamical quantities when using MTP electrostatics is possible.","59":"Protein structure formation in the membrane highlights a grand challenge of sampling in computer simulations, because kinetic traps and slow dynamics make it difficult to find the native state. Exploiting increased fluctuations at higher temperatures can help overcome free-energy barriers, provided the membrane\u2019s structure remains stable. In this work, we apply Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics, where we only tune the backbone hydrogen-bond strength to help reduce the propensity of long-lived misfolded states. Using a recently developed coarse-grained model, we illustrate the robustness of the method by folding different WALP transmembrane helical peptides starting from stretched, unstructured conformations. We show the efficiency of the method by comparing to simulations without enhanced sampling, achieving folding in one example after significantly longer simulation times. Analysis of the bilayer structure during folding provides insight into the local membrane deformation during helix formation as a function of chain length (from 16 to 23 residues). Finally, we apply our method to fold the 50-residue-long major pVIII coat protein (fd coat) of the filamentous fd bacteriophage. Our results agree well with experimental structures and atomistic simulations based on implicit membrane models, suggesting that our explicit CG folding protocol can serve as a starting point for better-refined atomistic simulations in a multiscale framework.","60":"An extension of the multiple time-step integration following Kopf et al. (1997) for the Langevin thermostat and modified Ander- sen barostat is described. Proper isothermal and isobaric properties are validated on a Lennard-Jones liquid and a coarse-grained peptide-lipid model. Measurements of the configurational temperature indicate proper canonical sampling, while folding simu- lations of unstructured peptides into transmembrane helices provide a realistic application and suggest the maximum set of time steps usable for that model.","61":"Accurate representation of the molecular electrostatic potential, which is often expanded in distributed multipole moments, is crucial for an efficient evaluation of intermolecular interactions. Here we introduce a machine learning model for multipole coefficients of atom types H, C, O, N, S, F, and Cl in any molecular conformation. The model is trained on quantum-chemical results for atoms in varying chemical environments drawn from thousands of organic molecules. Multipoles in systems with neutral, cationic, and anionic molecular charge states are treated with individual models. The models' predictive accuracy and applicability are illustrated by evaluating intermolecular interaction energies of nearly 1,000 dimers and the cohesive energy of the benzene crystal.","62":"We estimate polarizabilities of atoms in molecules without electron density, using a Voronoi tesselation approach instead of conventional density partitioning schemes. The resulting atomic dispersion coefficients are calculated, as well as many-body dispersion effects on intermolecular potential energies. We also estimate contributions from multipole electrostatics and compare them to dispersion. We assess the performance of the resulting intermolecular interaction model from dispersion and electrostatics for more than 1300 neutral and charged, small organic molecular dimers. Applications to water clusters, the benzene crystal, the anti-cancer drug ellipticine-intercalated between two Watson-Crick DNA base pairs, as well as six macro-molecular host-guest complexes highlight the potential of this method and help to identify points of future improvement. The mean absolute error made by the combination of static electrostatics with many-body dispersion reduces at larger distances, while it plateaus for two-body dispersion, in conflict with the common assumption that the simple 1\/R(6) correction will yield proper dissociative tails. Overall, the method achieves an accuracy well within conventional molecular force fields while exhibiting a simple parametrization protocol.","63":"The two-dimensional infrared spectrum of NMAH and NMAD in H2O and D2O is computed on the basis of force field parametrizations ranging from standard point charge (PC) to more elaborate multipolar (MTP) representations of the electrostatics. For the latter, the nonbonded parameters (MTP and van der Waals) were optimized to reproduce thermodynamic data. The frequency trajectory and frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) are determined from explicit frequency calculations on \u223c10(6) snapshots without using a more traditional \"mapping\" approach. This allows us to both sample configurations and compute observables in a consistent fashion. In agreement with experiment, the FFCF shows one very rapid time scale (in the 50 fs range) followed by one or two longer time scales. In the case of three time scales, the intermediate one is \u22480.5 ps or shorter, whereas the longest time scale can extend up to 2 or 3 ps. All interaction models lead to three time scales in the FFCF when fitted to an empirical parametrized form. When two time scales are assumed-as is usually done in the analysis of experimental data-and the short time scale is fixed to the \u03c41 = 50-100 fs range, the correlation time \u03c4c from the simulations ranges from 0.7 to 1 ps, which agrees quite well with experimentally determined values. The major difference between MTP and PC models is the observation that the later decay times in the FFCF are longer for simulations with MTPs. Also, the amplitude of the FFCF is reduced when simulations are carried out with MTPs. Overall, however, PC-based models perform well compared to those based on MTPs for NMAD in D2O and can be recommended for such investigations in the context of peptide and protein simulations.","64":"Interfacial systems are at the core of fascinating phenomena in many disciplines, such as biochemistry, soft-matter physics, and food science. However, the parametrization of accurate, reliable, and consistent coarse-grained (CG) models for systems at interfaces remains a challenging endeavor. In the present work, we explore to what extent two independently developed solvent-free CG models of peptides and lipids--of different mapping schemes, parametrization methods, target functions, and validation criteria--can be combined by only tuning the cross-interactions. Our results show that the cross-parametrization can reproduce a number of structural properties of membrane peptides (for example, tilt and hydrophobic mismatch), in agreement with existing peptide-lipid CG force fields. We find encouraging results for two challenging biophysical problems: (i) membrane pore formation mediated by the cooperative action of several antimicrobial peptides, and (ii) the insertion and folding of the helix-forming peptide WALP23 in the membrane.","65":"The description of molecular systems using multipolar electrostatics calls for automated methods to fit the necessary parameters. In this paper, we describe an open-source software package that allows fitting atomic multipoles (MTPs) from the ab initio electrostatic potential by adequate atom typing and judicious assignment of the local axis system. By enabling the simultaneous fit of several molecules and\/or conformations, the package addresses issues of parameter transferability and lack of sampling for buried atoms. We illustrate the method by studying a series of small alcohol molecules, as well as various conformations of protonated butylamine.","66":"Multipole (MTP) electrostatics provides the means to describe anisotropic interactions in a rigorous and systematic manner. A number of earlier molecular dynamics (MD) implementations have increasingly relied on the use of molecular symmetry to reduce the (possibly large) number of MTP interactions. Here, we present a CHARMM implementation of MTP electrostatics in terms of spherical harmonics. By relying on a systematic set of reference-axis systems tailored to various chemical environments, we obtain an implementation that is both efficient and scalable for (bio)molecular systems. We apply the method to a series of halogenated compounds to show (i) energy conservation; (ii) improvements in reproducing thermodynamic properties compared to standard point-charge (PC) models; (iii) performance of the code; and (iv) better stabilization of a brominated ligand in a target protein, compared to a PC force field. The implementation provides interesting perspectives toward a dual PC\/MTP resolution, \u00e0 la QM\/MM.","67":"Permanent multipoles (MTPs) embody a natural extension to common point-charge (PC) representations in atomistic simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative to the computationally expensive MTP molecular dynamics simulations by running a simple PC simulation and later reevaluate-\"score''-all energies using the more detailed MTP force field. The method, which relies on the assumption that the PC and MTP force fields generate closely related phase spaces, is accomplished by enforcing identical sets of monopoles between the two force fields-effectively highlighting the higher MTP terms as a correction to the PC approximation. We first detail our consistent parametrization of the electrostatics and van der Waals interactions for the two force fields. We then validate the method by comparing the accuracy of protein-ligand binding free energies from both PC and MTP-scored representations with experimentally determined binding constants obtained by us. Specifically, we study the binding of several arylsulfonamide ligands to human carbonic anhydrase II. We find that both representations yield an accuracy of 1 kcal\/mol with respect to experiment. Finally, we apply the method to rank the energetic contributions of individual atomic MTP coefficients for molecules solvated in water. All in all, MTP scoring is a computationally appealing method that can provide insight into the multipolar electrostatic interactions of condensed-phase systems.","68":"A combination of coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic simulations provides a suitable computational framework to study unstructured regions of proteins, for which experimental data are often lacking or limited. In this work, we combine CG and atomistic simulations with clustering algorithms and free energy reweighting methods to explore the conformational equilibrium of certain regions of the salt-stable cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (SS-CCMV). In particular, we focus on the geometry of converging strands (residues 26-49) from contacting subunits at the 3-fold (hexamer) and 5-fold (pentamer) symmetry points of the capsid. We show the following: (i) The simulations reproduce the experimentally observed \u03b2-barrel for the hexamer. (ii) The pentamer geometry is unable to stabilize a \u03b2-barrel conformation; it assumes various states instead, again in accordance with the experimental results which do not indicate a well-defined structure for the pentameric interface. (iii) Atomistic simulations of the backmapped CG structures remain relatively stable, indicative of plausible CG conformations and slow kinetics on the atomistic level.","69":"Two-state cooperativity is an important characteristic in protein folding. It is defined by a depletion of states that lie energetically between folded and unfolded conformations. There are different ways to test for two-state cooperativity; however, most of these approaches probe indirect proxies of this depletion. Generalized-ensemble computer simulations allow us to unambiguously identify this transition by a microcanonical analysis on the basis of the density of states. Here, we present a detailed characterization of several helical peptides obtained by coarse-grained simulations. The level of resolution of the coarse-grained model allowed to study realistic structures ranging from small \u03b1-helices to a de novo three-helix bundle without biasing the force field toward the native state of the protein. By linking thermodynamic and structural features, we are able to show that whereas short \u03b1-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate states. The helix bundle exhibits signs of two-state cooperativity owing to favorable helix-helix interactions, as predicted from theoretical models. A detailed analysis of secondary and tertiary structure formation fits well into the framework of several folding mechanisms and confirms features that up to now have been observed only in lattice models.","70":"Protein folding cooperativity is defined by the nature of the finite-size thermodynamic transition exhibited upon folding: two-state transitions show a free-energy barrier between the folded and unfolded ensembles, while downhill folding is barrierless. A microcanonical analysis, where the energy is the natural variable, has proved to be better suited than its canonical counterpart to unambiguously characterize the nature of the transition. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a high-resolution coarse-grained model allow for the accurate evaluation of the density of states in order to extract precise thermodynamic information and measure its impact on structural features. The method has been applied to three helical peptides: a short helix shows sharp features of a two-state folder, while a longer helix and a three-helix bundle exhibit downhill and two-state transitions, respectively. Extending the results of lattice simulations and theoretical models, we have found that it is the interplay between secondary structure and the loss of non-native tertiary contacts that determines the nature of the transition.","71":"A generic coarse-grained (CG) protein model is presented. The intermediate level of resolution (four beads per amino acid, implicit solvent) allows for accurate sampling of local conformations. It relies on simple interactions that emphasize structure, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobicity. Realistic alpha\/beta content is achieved by including an effective nearest-neighbor dipolar interaction. Parameters are tuned to reproduce both local conformations and tertiary structures. The thermodynamics and kinetics of a three-helix bundle are studied. We check that the CG model is able to fold proteins with tertiary structures and amino acid sequences different from the one used for parameter tuning. By studying both helical and extended conformations we make sure the force field is not biased toward any particular secondary structure. The accuracy involved in folding not only the test protein but also other ones show strong evidence for amino acid cooperativity embedded in the model. Without any further adjustments or bias a realistic oligopeptide aggregation scenario is observed.","72":"We propose a new algorithm for solving the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) equations to estimate free energies out of a set of Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The algorithm, based on free-energy differences, provides a more natural way of approaching the problem and improves convergence compared to the widely used direct iteration method. We also study how parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) of the independent simulations should be chosen to optimize the accuracy of the set of free energies."},"tldr":{"0":null,"1":"These de novo

multiscale method is analyzed by comparing its predictions for propanol insertion into a lipid membrane against conventional atomistic umbrella sampling simulation results, and the accuracy of the results is tightly connected to the presence of a good configuration overlap between the coarse-grained and atomistic models.","44":null,"45":null,"46":"High-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are introduced to screen thermodynamic properties and it is demonstrated how coarse graining helps reduce the size of chemical space, enabling a hierarchical approach to screening small molecules.","47":"Fluorescence measurements with surface-specific sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and coarse-grained computer simulations are used to demonstrate that NO2 -FAs alter lipid organization by accumulation at the membrane-water interface and suggest a molecular mechanism of the NO2-FA in vivo activity.","48":null,"49":"This work relies on Markov state models to simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide force fields\u2014one top-down and one bottom-up\u2014in order to improve the description of kinetics.","50":"Analysis of pair distribution functions and hydration free energies of halogenated benzenes provides a microscopic explanation why \"point charge\"-based representations with off-site charges fail in reproducing thermodynamic properties of the sigma-hole.","51":null,"52":"It is shown that refining the backbone contribution in PLUM significantly improves the PMF of insertion of the WALP16 transmembrane peptide, and illustrates difficulties associated with free-energy-based parametrizations of single-residue models, as the relevant free energy of partitioning used for force-field paramETrization does not arise from the entire residue but rather the solvent-accessible chemical groups.","53":"This work proposes a method that reweights the microscopic transitions of the system to improve consistency with a set of coarse kinetic observables and employs the well-developed Markov state modeling framework to efficiently link microscopic dynamics with long-time scale constraints, thereby consistently addressing a wide range of time scales.","54":"Folding of WALP in the two environments indicates the helix as the most stable structure, though with different relative stabilities and chain-length dependence, hinting at cooperative physics beyond the residue level.","55":"Antimicrobial lipopeptides (AMLPs\u2014part lipid, part peptide) have recently gained increasing interest, because they combine two attractive features: their mode of action is very generic and thus evolutionarily conserved; but unlike antimicrobial peptides, they involve much smaller molecular-weight peptides and are thus more in line with both practical and economical considerations of drug development.","56":"The simulations provide evidence for a well established CF-HOH hydrogen bond (population of 25%) which is found from the radial distribution function g(r) from both, force field and quantum mechanics\/molecular mechanics simulations.","57":"The present work aims at automating the mapping and parametrization of common small organic molecules for Martini, and demonstrates the feasibility of an automated parammetrization scheme forMartini and provides prospects for high-throughput simulation methodologies.","58":"The improved dynamical behavior found in the MTP simulations suggests that a systematic improvement of both equilibrium and dynamical quantities when using MTP electrostatics is possible.","59":"The results agree well with experimental structures and atomistic simulations based on implicit membrane models, suggesting that the explicit CG folding protocol can serve as a starting point for better-refined atomistic simulation in a multiscale framework.","60":"An extension of the multiple time-step integration following Kopf et al. (1997) for the Langevin thermostat and modified Ander- sen barostat is described, and proper isothermal and isobaric properties are validated on a Lennard-Jones liquid and a coarse-grained peptide-lipid model.","61":"A machine learning model for multipole coefficients of atom types H, C, O, N, S, F, and Cl in any molecular conformation is introduced, trained on quantum-chemical results

implementation that is both efficient and scalable for (bio)molecular systems.","67":"This work proposes an alternative to the computationally expensive MTP molecular dynamics simulations by running a simple PC simulation and later reevaluate-\"score''-all energies using the more detailed MTP force field, and proves the method is a computationally appealing method that can provide insight into the multipolar electrostatic interactions of condensed-phase systems.","68":"This work combines CG and atomistic simulations with clustering algorithms and free energy reweighting methods to explore the conformational equilibrium of certain regions of the salt-stable cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (SS-CCMV).","69":"It is shown that whereas short \u03b1-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate states.","70":"It is found that the interplay between secondary structure and the loss of non-native tertiary contacts that determines the nature of the transition between thermodynamics and structure for helical peptides using a high-resolution coarse-grained model.","71":"The accuracy involved in folding not only the test protein but also other ones show strong evidence for amino acid cooperativity embedded in the model, and the force field is made sure not to be biased toward any particular secondary structure.","72":"A new algorithm for solving the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) equations to estimate free
